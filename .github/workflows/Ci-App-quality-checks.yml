# Triggers
# -----------------------------
# - Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
# - Automatic trigger when 
#   a PR on master branch is opened/updated and application code is changed 
#   or when the workflows (build-and-test-lib.yml or build-and-test-app.yml or Ci-App-quality-checks.yml) are updated
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
